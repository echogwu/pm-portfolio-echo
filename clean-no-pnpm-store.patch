 - `next.config.mjs` currently has `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors = true`. That’s convenient during rapid iteration but can hide real issues; consider turning it off once the codebase stabilizes.
 - The repo includes a `lint` script, but lint tooling/config may be intentionally minimal right now; see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for recommendations.

+            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
+              Across large-scale platforms (Amazon, InMobi/AerServ, Oracle, IBM), production failures rarely came from
+              missing tests. They came from misunderstood system behavior: asynchronous workflows, weak data contracts,
+              environment-specific logic, and automation that validated the wrong assumptions.
+            </p>
+            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mt-4">The recurring pattern:</p>
+            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground/90 mt-4">
+              <li>Test suites passed while incidents escalated</li>
+              <li>Data pipelines degraded silently</li>
+              <li>Failures surfaced late, through customers or operations</li>
+              <li>Teams optimized for coverage instead of correctness</li>
+            </ul>
+            <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mt-6">
+              The challenge wasn’t execution quality — it was reasoning about complex systems with incomplete signals.

+              I partnered closely with engineers and PMs to validate correctness across APIs, services, and data flows.
